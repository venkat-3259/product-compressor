# image-compressor
A project is about to download a image and store it in our local storage by using fiber & RabbitMQ
I used swagger documentation tool to document my API routes.

When Ever the API is called with some link image it download in local storgae and compress it, after the image is compressed, it log in database.

this requires database connection which can be configured in config file
